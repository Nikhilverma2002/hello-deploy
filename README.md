# Configuration
    Branches and slots are defined in branches_config

    Add new branches by including the branch ID, name, and slot mappings.

    Each slot has a time and a corresponding slot ID required by the API.

# How It Works

    1. Sends POST requests to the Barbeque Nation API for each branch and slot.

    2. Extracts buffet data from the JSON response.

    3. Expands the remark field into individual slot rows (dashboard.py).

    4. Compares the current fetch with the last fetch to highlight changes.

    5. Displays data interactively in Streamlit, highlighting price updates.
